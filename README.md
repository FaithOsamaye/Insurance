## Introduction

Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss in which, in exchange for a fee, a party agrees to compensate another party in the event of a certain loss, damage, or injury. It is a form of risk management, primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.

## Problem Statement

1. What is the gender distribution like? And how has the total charges being influenced by this?

2. What is the age range distribution? And those this dsitribution have children and if so does it affect the charges?

3. Are the population healthy or not?

4. What region has the most number of people and what has being the total charg so far?


## Data Cleaning

This is a dummy dataset. and the data consists of just one table with 7 columns and over 1,000 rows. I created new columns(age range and bmi range) using conditional columns in the power query. The data was clean hence there was no need to replace values or any other form of cleaning.
A table for measures was created, with functions like SUM, AVERAGE and CALCULATE being used.

Which ultimately means the life insurance paid by the obese and overweight citizens would be lower due to them facing health challenges because of their health.
